# APOC Session Log

## 2026-04-08 — The War Room

### Accomplished
- 4 new agents: Cipher, Oracle, Jinx, Sage (v0.7), then Flux, Drift, Patch, Echo (v0.8)
- 11 total agents across 4 rooms (Main, Project, Makers, Vision Space)
- 1,101 ambient emotes (100 per agent)
- Full Vault-Tec UI overhaul (navy/blue/yellow palette)
- 22 expression types, mouse-tracking eyes, Christopher's cape
- 6 new commands: /iterate, /freeform, /mute, /unmute, /stop, /save
- Complete prompt architecture rewrite (prompting guide + interaction tuning)
- CI auto-deploy via GitHub Actions + Cloudflare Pages
- Scribe Notes vault folder for clean Obsidian integration
- Cloudflare Access protecting production
- Multiple model swaps (Mistral, Sage, Cipher) to resolve quality issues

### Known Issues
- Sage and Oracle share same model (Gemma 4 26B), monitor for blending
- Iteration agents still sometimes repeat themes across rounds
- Sidebar gets long with 11 agents + Christopher on smaller screens

### Next Steps

**The Intelligence Layer** (next session)
- Herald agent: News intelligence via Brave Search API (worker route, API key)
- Signal agent: Reddit intelligence via public JSON API (worker route, subreddit config)
- Both follow same pattern: agent fetches external data through worker, then responds conversationally

**The Creator** (same or next session)
- Prism agent: Image generation via Cloudflare Workers AI (FLUX.1 Schnell)
- Requires [ai] binding in wrangler.toml, new /api/image worker route
- Image rendering in MessageBubble.tsx

**The Memory** (future session)
- Persistent memory via Cloudflare D1 (SQLite on edge)
- Tables: memories (agent_id, content, topic_tags, importance) + sessions (summary)
- Agents recall previous sessions, Scribe auto-stores key decisions
- Biggest single remaining feature

**Polish**
- Mobile responsive pass (sidebar collapse for small screens)
- Rebrand from APOC to new name (TBD)

## 2026-04-07 — Launch Day

### Accomplished
- Built APOC from scratch: spec to deployed product in one session
- v0.1: Core chat room with Gemma 4 31B, Cloudflare Worker proxy, streaming SSE
- v0.2: Complete UI overhaul to Fallout x Yahoo Lounge aesthetic (CRT scanlines, amber/green phosphor, 3 rooms, slash commands, markdown, sounds, mood, search)
- v0.3: Added Mistral (creative agent) and Scribe (free note-taker on Nemotron 3 Nano 30B), Obsidian export, @agent targeting
- v0.4: Bug fixes (no auto-route to Gemma), sound overhaul (per-room/per-agent tones), hey-all command, agent profile modal, resizable sidebar, idle chatter, personality upgrades
- v0.5: Animated SVG avatars with expression engine (12 states, per-agent idle patterns), 70+ ambient emotes, Obsidian vault integration via Local REST API
- Deployed to Cloudflare Pages (apoc.pages.dev) + Worker proxy
- Also: Downloads folder audit and reorganization (Phase 1-3)

### Known Issues
- Cloudflare Pages deploys are manual (no CI from GitHub yet)
- Free model rate limits on OpenRouter can cause 429s
- Obsidian vault integration requires Local REST API plugin with HTTP enabled (port 27123)
- Idle chatter system prompt sometimes leaks into visible messages

### Next Steps (Backlog)
- Cloudflare Pages CI (auto-deploy on push)
- Agent-to-agent debate mode (`/discuss`)
- More agents (coder, researcher)
- Persistent memory via Cloudflare KV
- Theme switcher
- Notification system for cross-room activity
- Custom agent builder
- Mobile polish
